            <li><strong>Like the red wolf, it is distinguished from other Canis species by its larger size and less pointed features, particularly on the ears and muzzle.</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Its winter fur is long and bushy and predominantly a mottled gray in color, although nearly pure white</strong></li>
            <li><strong>The gray wolf is typically an apex predator throughout its range, with only humans and tigers posing a serious threat to it.</strong></li>
        </ol>
        <p><em>Non-rabid wolves have attacked and killed people, mainly children, but this is rare, as wolves are relatively few</em></p>
